            Well, this is my proposed support system for helping the art community! 
            Here, I wanted to create a sort of <b>freedom wall dedicated to artists and to everyone interested in art</b>.
            After all, the internet is a good way to connect people from all across the globe.

            Well, to <b>unite the art community</b> of course! Artists from all across the globe can gather and share their thoughts here.

            Lots of stuff! 
            It can be a <b>chat forum for any art topic</b> under the sun, it can be a <b>tutorials page for budding artists</b> wishing to learn "how to art", it can even be a place where artists ask for <b>constructive criticism from other artists</b>! The limits are endless.

        <section class="p-4">
            Everyday, new ideas are being brought by artists yet are never received by other fellow enjoyers in the community.
            Those <b>brilliant ideas must be shared with the world</b>, thus the creation of this prototype.

        <section class="card-footer">
            Most importantly though, this support system would hopefully act as a <b>central hub and a safe space for artists to grow and develop their skills amidst the cruelties of reality</b>.
